# Data-Analysis
The codes were made for assignment purpose in Data Analysis Course (EE 201)

### Instructions on running the courses
The codes can be run on standard R-Studio which needs an additional installation of R official package. After installing, both R and R-Studio, the codes can be run in them. However the codes can be run in the official R package only. But the GUI of R-Studio is way better than the official R-Console.

### Assignment Structure
Each assignment consists of Problem Statement and it's corresponding codes in R. Some codes have in-built functions used. In, some codes we have incorporated our logics to make our functions instead of inbuilt functions.

#### Assignment 1
The assignment basically requires us to find the central tendencies for the randomly generated numbers. We have the file named 1.r which has the final code which can be readily implemented. 

#### Assignment 2
The assignment basically requires us to plot different types of graphs for the data we are finding. We have the file named 2.r which has the final code which can be readily implemented.

#### Assignment 3
The assignment basically requires us to prove the Central Limit Theorem. We have the file named 3.r which has the final code which can be readily implemented. Furthermore, some data sets were chosen and then modelled and trained accordingly to as to fetch the required result.
